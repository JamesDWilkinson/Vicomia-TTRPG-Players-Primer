# Vicomia TTRPG Players Primer
 This is a mask for the GURPS 4e system; GURPS 4e is difficult to use but has some really great features like the Disadvantages system. In this system, players are not expected to look in any GURPS manual, nor are they expected to create their own characters using GURPS character creation. In general, they are expected to tell the GM what they would like to do; the GM might check if the player really wants to do that, tell them if and how they need to roll, and what happens. Players are free to roleplay, create characters—that fit into the world and game—easily by using a system similar to D&D5e or WHFRP4e, and tell the DM what they want to do, getting a consistent gaming experience in return. The GM is expected to have good knowledge of the GURPS 4e system, and most of the material in all GURPS supplements will be easily usable with this masked version of the system.
